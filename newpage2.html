									<p>Finally!!!!! The day was here, Saturday 2nd of August I was so excited I couldn't sleep the night before because I was going to the RAVE dance competition. As soon as I woke up, I raced down to the kitchen and gobbled up my breakfast and quickly got ready.</br></br>
Once I was ready mum took me to my dance studio. All of my friends were there; as I was talking to them I was telling them how nervous I was. Amy, Darci, Peta, Perri and Lauren were just as nervous as I was Phew!! That was a relief. Now we were ready to go and we left for Port Pirie.</br></br>
We finally arrived in Port Pirie and another friend of mine Courtney, helped me carry my stuff into the Keith Mitchell Theatre. We saw Molly, another one of our dancers. She had a solo the night before and she got 2nd place. We were now waiting for Kelsey and we couldn't enter our dressing room until she was there. It was so boring waiting.</br></br>
She finally arrived and we went into our dressing room. Once we were settled in, we went to our stage rehearsal. We saw another group perform and they were brilliant. It was now our turn to get on that stage. OMG! I was so nervous but we all danced perfectly. Once we finished our rehearsal we went to an awesome Hip Hop workshop which was really fast but FUN. ?
Finally people started to come. Now I was really nervous, but excited at the same time. Our group was sitting down eating lunch and getting our make - up done. When we were ready with our costumes on, we got to watch some of the other dancers perform. We were act 20. Some of the dancers were beautiful.</br></br>
It was finally our turn, I was so nervous but we danced beautifully. Once we had all performed the judges announced the winners. Our dance group came in 3rd. We were overwhelmed. We didn't think we would get a place. We were there for the fun and the experience. When mum and dad came to pick me up, I was so exhausted I fell asleep in the car.</p>
