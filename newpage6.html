																	<blockquote>

whoever coined the phrase ‘good things come in small packages’ would no doubt be more adamant than ever after watching Lara Wong on-stage. The petite Perth born dancer has an effortless knack for movement that makes you prone to wondering if talent really is predestined after all. The true reason for her current success though (whilst less prosaic), is a

combination of practice, passion, and sheer perseverance that’s been present since she was just three years old. Good work ethic and the usual dose of blood, sweat and tears are nothing new for dancers, but what makes Chanel somewhat of a rarity is her seemingly impartial command over so many diverse genres of dance. It’s not often you meet someone who can transfix audiences in pointe shoes, and just as easily transition into urban or jazz with all the requisite panache, and

then some.</br></br>

2017 proved to be a pivotal year for Chanel when she was selected to join Marko Panzic’s groundbreaking Dream Dance Company for their third exhilarating season, Enter the Vortex, giving her the chance to show local and international audiences the full scope of her abilities as both artist and performer. If you haven’t had the pleasure of catching Chanel on-stage yet, we’re confident you’ll only be seeing more and more of this fresh new talent. </blockquote>
