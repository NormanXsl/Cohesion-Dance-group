										<h2>Graduation is an unforgetable memory</h2>

									<p>Our first show at the festival was on the first day at Alexander theatre. We showed up nice and early before our midnight spot to discover a mini drama taking place. The first band had come across the house ‘drum kit’ (a mild overstatement). The kick drum had been shredded to pieces to the point of making no sound and there were no cymbal stands… bummer. But, this was New York, so we hopped a taxi to a music store that opened late, purchased a new kick drum skin and pretended nothing had happened. We played with four bands from the Australia, and one that stood out were ‘Holy Wave’ – a super psychedelic, washed out wall of sound experience. We think they had a pretty BJM, Velvet Underground sound. Check them out.</p>

									<p>Come midnight and a few three dollar Budweisers later and it was our turn. A vibey show was had by all… we had a blast, need we review ourselves past that</p>

										<h3>Post show time</h3>

									<p>Post show, a couple of us went to bed, and a couple decided to have ‘one more drink’ at a local bar called Duck Duck. The one more drink turned into 5am drinks for Dan and Jarrad with Dap from Das Racist, as this was his local bar too. Conversation included the state of ‘Aussie Hip Hop’ in the world…</p>
